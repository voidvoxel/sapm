# Silver Ant Package Manager (`sapm`)

[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/voidvoxel/sapm/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/voidvoxel/sapm)

`sapm` is a distributed package manager for JavaScript designed to remove the
need for centralized package distribution servers.
`sapm` distributes packages through a decentralized network when possible and
only falls back to the centralized side of the ecosystem whenever absolutely
necessary (i.e. no peers are sharing a package that you require).

## Features

* [ ] `sapm init`
* [ ] `sapm install`
* [ ] `sapm publish`
* [ ] `sapm uninstall`
